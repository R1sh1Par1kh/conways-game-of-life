Hey people! On an infinite two-dimensional rectangular grid of cells, The Game of Life (an example of a cellular automata) is played. Either an individual cell is alive or dead. Each game move, also known as a generation, involves a change in each cell's status based on the conditions (dead or alive) of its eight neighbors. Cells that touch another cell in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal direction are said to be that cell's neighbors. Remember that you will need two players to play. We start with a 30x58 grid of cells, either alive or dead. Here are the rules: 

1) Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation. 

2) Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation. 

3) Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.  

4) Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction. 

Have fun ðŸ˜€!
